# Winux - Linux-like Experience in Windows

**Winux** is a project that brings the Linux command-line experience to Windows. By simulating popular Linux commands, we aim to make Windows feel a bit more like Linux while still leveraging the power of the Windows ecosystem. 

## Features
- **Command Simulation**: Our goal is to recreate as many Linux commands as possible, providing a familiar interface for Linux users on Windows. Commands like `neofetch`, `ls`, `sudo`, and many more will be available to interact with your system in a way that feels like Linux.
  
- **Script Inserter**: We understand that the Linux command line is highly customizable, so we are introducing a script inserter that will allow users to create and add their own custom commands into the Winux environment.

## Future Plans
We aim to add more features over time, improving command support and expanding the script inserter. Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to contribute!
